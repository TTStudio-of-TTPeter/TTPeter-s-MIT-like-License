# TTPeter-s-MIT-like-License
Here is a explanation of my customized MIT license. And here has an example.

## NAME

Well, I haven't thought out. And I don't know if it's welcomed. So I just call it: `TTPeter's MIT-like License`.

## Projects I applied it and as examples

- [ThreadKiller](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/ThreadKiller)

The Next Section of **explanation** is copied from `ThreadKiller` project's readme.

## Why I create this MIT-like customized license

I know it's just a small project. But I don't want to see if there is anyone sell my codes for benefits of their own. And I don't want to see anyone copy my codes and change a little bit then declares that his work base on it. So I add a limit of 30% difference. Within that percent, You should not sell them but distribute them for free. For other commercial use, such a low subscribing price is a support for developers' work and this won't become a burden for businesses. 

I know there are some protocols require declaration of changes. But I just thought that would be to a complicated work sometimes. So in this customized MIT license, only percentage of difference is considered. The percentage could be customized by developers for actual circumstances. 

To unlock the limit, pay a small amount and developers are supposed to return you a said new license. In this project, the new license will be true MIT license.

This license type is my effort to balance dream and survival in free software field. (Free software refers to open-sourced software.)

If you like my work, please tell it to people around you or use it for your own projects. Thanks!

## Template

```
MIT-like License
Unlike MIT license, you cannot sell the copies. But you still have other 
rights a MIT license will give.
If you want to use commercially, sell only modified versions with at least 
30% difference or contact through project's email to buy a MIT license. 
Otherwise, you should redistribute them for free.

If you opened the project and want only specific version to apply this license, see that `LICENSE` file in my `ThreadKiller` Project. That would be a good example!
